MIS 122

Roles:

* Front End: Dani team
	* please start on HTML/CSS on your pace. Later either push them down git via git add --all > git commit -m "message: l0rd juzko" > git push origin master
	* if you find problems using git, kindly message me or Dani your files. The goal is to unify all CSS para hindi messy because mahirap i-keep track pag madami
	
* Back End: Dani and me
	* Models are done.
	* Make associations na para may foreign key
	* Delve into session tokens
	* Look into sql, how it goes into ruby, and where to find them kasi we will need explicit sql statements sa final deliverable. (parang ruby makes them naman automatically through code???)
